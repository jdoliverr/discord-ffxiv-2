Discord bot for Final Fantsy 14 gear tracking.

Accepts commands proceeded by '!' then checks to see if the command exists in the commands folder. If the command exists the bot responds in the same text channel with the designated response.

To create a new command, make a new file in the commands folder(suggested to name it the same as the command input). Copy the contents of cmdTemplate.js into the new file. Change the 'name' value to the expected command input then change the string 'response' to the desired output. From there the new command should function.
